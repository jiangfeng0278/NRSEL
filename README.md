# Title:
The ensemble method NRSEL

# Aim:
We proposed a novel ensemble method (called NRSEL) based on neighborhood rough sets, and applied it to software fault prediction.

Note: the code for NRSEL will be released soon.

# About Dataset:
In our experiment, we have used 20 data sets collected from real-world software projects. The 20 data sets include 10 data sets from the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP) repository [1], and 10 data sets from the Promise repository [2].
